## Magic: The Gathering card analysis

View the [README](https://github.com/tramsey19/mtg-cardanalysis/blob/master/README.md) to get started.

Or if you're feeling adventurous, jump right in to the [EDHREC Data Collection](https://github.com/tramsey19/mtg-cardanalysis/blob/master/EDHREC%20Data%20Collection.ipynb).

If you've already gathered the data, you can check out the [deep learning model](https://github.com/tramsey19/mtg-cardanalysis/blob/master/Card%20Analysis.ipynb) that will analyze the oracle text on all cards and make a prediction of powerful/not powerful (with 99.5% accuracy!). Or if you'd rather look at a specific commander, you can analyze the power level of a specfic deck and compare it to the average power level of that commander with the [Commander Analysis](https://github.com/tramsey19/mtg-cardanalysis/blob/master/Commander%20Analysis.ipynb) file.
